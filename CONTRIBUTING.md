Hey there, thanks for considering contributing to this project!

This guide is early and will be updated as the project receives contributions.


# Culture and Reviewing

We will operate out of Discussions rather than Issues.

(If this becomes unmaintainable, we'll consider moving to a chat platform like
Discourse, Discord, Matrix, etc.)

We will understand that _most contributors_ will probably not read this
document, so we will act graciously towards them.

If a maintainer has only minor editing feedback (spelling, grammar, etc),
instead of asking for changes, consider merging the contributor's work, and
adding an editing commit right after.


# Style Guide

Pages should read somewhat coherently, and should be somewhere between the
equivalent of 1 to 10 pages. A new page may simply be a stub with some lists
on it. An older page should tend towards more structure, starting with a
summary, moving into small "chapters" with subheadings.

The content should remain factual. Aside from the README, content should avoid
opinions or vague "people (do/don't) like" statements. For example, "Rust is
great" or "Developers love Rust" are entirely defensible opinions, but these
are not factual. "Rust has been voted 'Most Admired' for X years in
StackOverflow surveys" on the other hand is factual and could be included in
a summary.

Outright advertising, like a company's "Careers" page, or direct
"call to action" language ("see if ____ is right for you!") is contrary to this
project's goals.

If you do have opportunities and want to reach experts in a niche field,
consider putting together reports valuable to those experts that this project
could reference. An example would be the [COBOL Today][cobol-today] report by
COBOL Cowboys. An even better report (for this project) would link references.


# What Is "Notable Use"?

Each entry should roughly be a "Greatest Hits" for its technology.

In other words, the rules for what to highlight and how much will vary by
relative usage _within_ that technology. As an example, Amazon uses Ruby in
its build tooling, and has a large (>80k) developer population. That will be a
relatively insignificant usage in the context of all worldwide Ruby usage, even
though for other technologies it might be enormous.

The criteria for "notable" is also subject to interpretation. For particularly
influential languages, consider multiple categories:

* Companies
* Governments
* Non-Profits
* Academic/Scientific Communities
* Awards (Nobel, Millenium Prize)
* Historical Achievements


# Additional Sections

It's ok to include links to additional resources that help paint a picture of
technology usage. For example, an active community job board, or a list of
companies using a technology are ok. A direct link to a recruiting firm or
consultancy that specializes in the language is not ok.
