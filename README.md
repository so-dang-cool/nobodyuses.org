> "Computing has turned into pop culture"

Over and over [I][bp] have heard remarks like "Ruby is dead" or "nobody really uses C anymore"
_even in the comment section of [GitHub][gh]_, a massive Ruby on Rails website, for projects
managed by [Git][git], a mostly-C CLI.

The greater computing industry has little sense of history, even when the history is as
recent as _right now!_. We operate as a pop culture and are particularly influenced by
recency bias. This can be excused in an industry where we build on hardware that has seen
decades of sustained exponential growth. (See: [Moore's Law][moore]) But as unavoidable as
it may be, we also benefit from keeping the record straight!

Also, it's not just the old technologies that get overlooked. Newcomers, underdogs, and
outcasts also have their impact overlooked. Odin, R, Prolog, Ada, and many others also
are used in ways that surprise many.

This is a website intended to catalog the most notable uses of any given programming language,
framework, or other technology.

And remember kids, just because everyone uses Spring (or React, or whatever) it doesn't mean
it's the best choice out there. Just because something is chosen less or discussed less
doesn't mean it's worse.
