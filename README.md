Over and over [I][bp] hear remarks like "Ruby is dead" or "nobody really uses C
anymore" _even in the comment section of [GitHub][gh]_, a massive Ruby on Rails
website, for projects managed by [Git][git], a mostly-C CLI.

The greater computing industry has little sense of history, even when the
history is as recent as _right now!_. We operate as a pop culture and are
particularly influenced by recency bias. This can be excused in an industry
where we build on hardware that has seen decades of sustained exponential
growth. (See: [Moore's Law][moore]) But as unavoidable as it may be, we also
benefit from keeping the record straight!

Also, it's not just the old technologies that get overlooked. Newcomers,
underdogs, and outcasts also have their impact overlooked. Odin, R, Prolog,
Ada, and many others also are used in ways that surprise many.

This is a website intended to catalog the most notable uses of any given
programming language, framework, or other technology.

And remember kids, just because everyone uses Spring (or React, or whatever) it
doesn't mean it's the best tool for the job. These massive communities tend to
draw in a lot of documentation and examples, but the quality range tends to
expand with the size of a community. Just because something is chosen less or
discussed less doesn't mean it's worse.

Learn, teach, and make things you can be proud of.
