# Dumb Site Generator (POSIX + Markdown via Pandoc)

This is a template for generating your own Static Site Generator.

It's powered by common POSIX utilities like `sh`, `envsubst`, and `awk`. This
version also requires pandoc for markdown-to-html markup translation.

Feel free to clone it and hack it up into whatever you want it to be.
