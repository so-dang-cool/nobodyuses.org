Over and over [I][bp] have heard remarks like "Ruby is dead" or "nobody really uses C anymore"
_even in the comment section of [GitHub][gh]_, a massive Ruby on Rails website, for projects
managed by [Git][git], a mostly-C CLI.

The greater computing industry has little sense of history, we operate as a pop culture and
are particularly influenced by recency bias. In an industry where we build on hardware that
has seen sustained exponential growth for decades (See: [Moore's Law][moore]) this may
have been unavoidable... But also we benefit from keeping the record straight!

But it's not just the old technologies. Newcomers, underdogs, and outcasts can also have their
impact overlooked. Prolog, Ada, R, Odin, and many others also have uses

This is a website intended to catalog the most notable uses of any given programming language,
framework, or other technology.

And remember kids, just because everyone uses Spring (or React, or whatever) it doesn't mean
it's better. Just because something may be chosen or discussed less doesn't mean it's worse.
